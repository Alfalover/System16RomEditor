# System16RomEditor
SEGA System 16 Rom editor, allow replace graphics on old arcade games

 I changed OUTRUN Arcade game images to put a cabinet on my wedding, 
 I share my code if someone found it useful 
 
 Maybe Test do not pass because you need original rom files, that I didnt put here
 for obvious reasons
 
 Tested only with this file set:
 
 mpr-10371.9
 mpr-10373.10
 mpr-10375.11
 mpr-10377.12
 
 or 
 
 mpr-10372.13
 mpr-10374.14
 mpr-10376.15
 mpr-10378.16
 
 You should open 4 of them at same time images are spread through 4 files due they use
 parallel 4 rom chips to create a 32bits access memory, great '80 :)
